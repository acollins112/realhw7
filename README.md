To create a website that is a survey for undergraduate students, the first step is to determine the questions that need to be asked. In this case, the survey asks for basic information such as the student's favorite color, major, name, and gender. Once the questions are determined, the next step is to design the form using HTML and CSS. It is important to consider the user experience when designing the form, and to use a variety of input types to make the survey more engaging.

One of the key design elements of the survey form is the use of a drop-down box for the user to select their gender. This input type is ideal for this question because it allows for a clear and concise answer while minimizing user error. Additionally, the use of a text box for the user to enter their name allows for greater flexibility in formatting, allowing the user to enter their name in any order they prefer. Overall, the undergraduate student survey form is designed with best practices in mind, and provides an excellent user experience for those completing the survey.
